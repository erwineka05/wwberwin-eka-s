            <h4 id="first_take">First vtuber who perform at The First Take</h4>
            <br>
            Hololive’s Hoshimachi Suisei continues to impress as she just became the first ever VTuber to perform at The First Take.
            <br><br>
            In case you’re wondering why this is a big deal, The First Take is a popular Japanese YouTube channel that features some of Japan’s artists and bands. The concept of the channel is that each artist/band has one take to perform their song, making it feel more “live” than a typical performance.
            <br><br>
            To give you a better idea, The First Take has features popular Japanese artists such as Lisa (of Demon Slayer and SAO fame), YOASOBI, Aimer, and many more.
